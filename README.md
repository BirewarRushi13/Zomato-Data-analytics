## Project Description

- Project aims to develop a recommendation model and visualize insights for startups who are planning to open remote kitchen by leveraging data scraped from the Zomato.
- The primary goal is to provide competitive insights and suggestions regarding pricing and location for restaurants.
- The recommendation model will analyze the scraped data and generate recommendations for optimal price for one person and locations for opening new remote restaurants or improving existing ones.

## Key Features

- Web scraping to collect restaurant data from Zomato.
- Data processing and analysis to identify trends, patterns, and correlations.
- Machine learning models for generating pricing and location recommendations.
- Interactive Power BI dashboard for visualizing insights.
- User-friendly recommendation model website.

## Technologies Used

- **Python and Libraries**
  * Beautiful Soup (for web scraping)
  * Pandas (for data manipulation)
  * Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
  * Flask (for backend API)
  * Joblib (for model serialization)

- **Visualization Tool**
  * Power BI (for data visualization)

- **Website**
  * ReactJS (for frontend)
  * Material-UI (for UI components)
  * Axios (for API communication)
  * CSS3 (for custom styling)

## Challenges

- **Handling Cuisine Values**: One of the major challenges was dealing with the diverse cuisine values provided by different restaurants. Each restaurant served a unique combination of cuisines, making it difficult to standardize and categorize them effectively.

- **Backend Development and Integration**: Creating a backend using Flask and integrating it with a React frontend posed its own set of challenges.

- **Machine Learning Model for Location Recommendations**: Developing a machine learning model to recommend optimal locations based on given inputs was a complex task. Improving models accuracy proved to be challenging.

- **Model Performance and Optimization**: Enhancing the model's predictive capabilities for better recommendations was an ongoing challenge that required further exploration.

## Conclusion

The project involved the development of machine learning models for predicting restaurant pricing and optimal locations. The performance of these models varied significantly:

### Price Prediction Model

The model developed for predicting the price for one person at a restaurant achieved an impressive accuracy score of over 90%. This high level of accuracy demonstrates the model's proficiency in analyzing various factors, such as cuisine type, location, and other relevant features, to provide reliable price estimates.

### Location Recommendation Model

However, predicting suitable locations proved to be a complex task.
